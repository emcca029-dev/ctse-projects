# üìû Project 3: Contact Management System

A Python console application built to effectively manage, store, and retrieve contact information.

## Project Goal

This project emphasizes the application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python, specifically demonstrating class design, inheritance, and encapsulation for data integrity.

## Functionality

* **Add Contact:** Creates a new contact object with attributes like name, phone, and email.
* **View Contacts:** Displays a list of all stored contacts.
* **Search/Retrieve:** Finds contacts based on a specified field (e.g., name).
* **Update/Delete:** Allows modification or removal of existing contacts.
* **Data Persistence:** Uses a basic file structure (e.g., CSV or JSON) to save data between sessions.

## Technical Stack

* **Python:** Core language for application logic.
* **OOP:** Classes (`Contact`, `ContactManager`) are central to the design.
* **File I/O:** Utilized for data persistence.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the branch.
2.  Execute the main script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python contact_manager.py
    ```
