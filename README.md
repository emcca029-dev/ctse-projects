# üåê Project 1: Personal Portfolio Website

This professional portfolio website serves as a dedicated showcase for my skills, projects, and educational journey at Coding Temple.

## Project Goal

The primary goal was to demonstrate mastery of modern **HTML, CSS, and Responsive Design** principles by building a visually appealing and highly accessible website from scratch.

## Key Features

* **Clean UI/UX:** Intuitive navigation and a professional design focused on readability.
* **Fully Responsive:** Implemented using CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure perfect scaling on any device size.
* **Project Linking:** Clear sections dedicated to highlighting the projects contained within this repository's other branches.
* **Accessibility (A11y):** Focus on semantic HTML and appropriate ARIA roles.

## Technical Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and organization of content.
* **CSS3:** Advanced layout techniques (Flexbox & Grid), transitions, and keyframe animations.
* **JavaScript:** Minor interactivity (e.g., mobile navigation toggle, scroll effects).
