# ✅ Project 1: To-Do List Application

A simple command-line interface (CLI) application for tracking daily tasks.

## Project Goal

This serves as a foundational project to showcase basic **Python scripting, function design, and core control flow** (loops, conditionals) without relying on complex frameworks. It focuses on the fundamental CRUD operations applied to a list.

## Core Features

* **Add Task:** Allows the user to input a new task.
* **View Tasks:** Displays the current list of tasks with their status.
* **Mark Complete:** Updates the status of a task.
* **Remove Task:** Deletes a task from the list.

## Technical Stack

* **Python:** Used entirely for the simple CLI interface and list manipulation.
* **Data Structure:** Utilizes Python lists or dictionaries for task storage.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the branch.
2.  Execute the script:
    ```bash
    python todo.py
    ```
    The application will then prompt you with options (Add, View, Complete, Exit).
