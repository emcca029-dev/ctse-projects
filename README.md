# üí∞ Project 2: Budget Tracker Application

A single-page application (SPA) designed to help users track their income and expenses, providing a visual overview of their personal finances.

## Project Scope

This project was critical for solidifying **complex state management** and **dynamic list rendering** in React. It manages transaction data locally (e.g., using browser storage or simple JS arrays) without requiring a dedicated backend.

## Key Features

* **Transaction Input:** Users can submit income or expense transactions with category and amount.
* **Real-time Calculations:** Automatically calculates the current balance and provides a breakdown of total income vs. expenses.
* **Data Visualization:** Simple display (e.g., a list or bar chart) to categorize spending.
* **Data Persistence:** Data is retained even after the page is closed (using local storage).

## Technical Stack

* **React:** Used for component architecture and managing the application's overall state.
* **useState/useReducer:** Core hooks utilized for efficient state handling.
* **JavaScript:** Logic for calculations, filtering, and data sorting.
* **Local Storage:** Used for basic data persistence between sessions.
