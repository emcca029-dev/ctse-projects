# üõí Project 3: Full-Stack E-commerce Application (Frontend)

This is the frontend client for a multi-page e-commerce platform, built as a core project in the Coding Temple Full-Stack curriculum.

## Project Overview

This application focuses on delivering a smooth, responsive shopping experience. It interacts asynchronously with the custom-built **E-commerce API** (located in the `project-1-e-commerce-api` branch) to manage products, user accounts, and cart state.

## Key Features

* **Product Catalog:** Displays products fetched from the backend API with filtering and search capabilities.
* **User Authentication:** Handles sign-up and log-in, managing user state via tokens/session.
* **Shopping Cart:** Allows users to add, update quantities, and remove items before checkout.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
